# BMPConverter
This is a simple tool to convert a BMP image into its negative, or vice-versa. 

# How To Use
 
1) Place the *.BMP file in the "bmp" directory.

2) In the main directory, type in the following command: "stack run filename.BMP"

3) Afterwards, there will be a negative of your image located in the bmp directory. The mapping looks likes this: bmp/Original.BMP -> bmp/OriginalNegative.BMP
